# This is run once, at cluster creation time and it creates a deployment and a
# service based on the latest functions image.
#
# The created server is configured so that it does NOT have persistent storage.
# It is only intended to be used as a test server and data can be thrown away.
#
# Updates are done by:
#    $ kubectl set image deployment/functions-master functions=NEW_IMAGE_FULL_PATH

# This may or may not be repeatable. Apparently registry.oracledx.com hands
# out the same auth token every time for the same combination of user/pass, 
# so this should work, but we have no guarantees. The problem is that if we
# don't create the secret in a yaml file we have to have a manual process to
# create it, which is not ideal.
